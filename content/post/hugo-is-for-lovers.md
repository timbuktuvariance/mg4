## Step 1. Install Hugo

Goto [hugo releases](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases) and download the
appropriate version for your os and architecture.

Save it somewhere specific as we will be using it in the next step.

More complete instructions are available at [installing hugo](/overview/installing/)

## Step 2. Build the Docs
